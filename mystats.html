         <p>Hey there! I am Bhargavi Tatineni from Vijayawada,India. I am currently pursuing my masters degree at North West Missouri State University.
            My hobbies are listening to music and playing games. My birthday is on April 28. I like things in an organized way.

         <h2>Crispy fried chicken is my favorite dish!</h2>
         <p>I like Crispy fried chicken the most because of the crunchiness it holds outside and the tenderness of fresh chicken inside.
            With correct proportion of toppings, crispy fried chicken is best when served hot along with ketchup and some french fries on the side. Yum Yum in the tum tum:)
